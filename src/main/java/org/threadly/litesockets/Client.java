 * will use this object.  The clients work by having buffered reads and writes for the socket. They tell the
 * SocketExecuter when a read can be added or a write is ready for the socket.</p>
 * 
 * <p>All reads are issued on a callback on a Reader in a single threaded manor.
 * All writes will be sent in the order they are received.  In general its better to write full protocol parsable
 * packets with each write where possible.  If not possible your own locking/ordering will have to be ensured.
 * Close events will happen on there own Closer callback but it uses the same ThreadKey as the Reader thread.  
 * All Reads should be received before a close event happens.</p>
 * 
 * The client object can not function with out being in a SocketExecuter.  Writes can be added before its put
 * in the executer, but it will not write to the socket until added to the executer.
