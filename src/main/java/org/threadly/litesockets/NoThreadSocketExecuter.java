/**
 * <p>The NoThreadSocketExecuter is a simpler implementation of a {@link SocketExecuter} 
 * that does not create any threads. Since there are no threads operations happen on whatever thread
 * calls .select(), and only 1 thread at a time should ever call it at a time.  Other then
 * that it should be completely thread safe.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is generally the implementation used by clients.  It can be used for servers
 * but only when not servicing many connections at once.  How many connections is hardware
 * and OS defendant.  For an average multi-core x86 linux server I a connections not to much more
 * then 1000 connections would be its limit, though alot depends on how active those connections are.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It should also be noted that all client read/close callbacks happen on the thread that calls select().</p>
